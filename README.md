# Notifier

Receive a message on Discord whenever a new episode of an anime airs/has released.

# To-do

- Give the user a list of all airing shows from database, that way they can directly copy it and not have to work about any typos in the title. Let them specify either a day or a title.

- Support for animepahe, crunchyroll, funimation, and other sites.

- Add filters for feed channels. 

- Sync watchlists

- Organize internal classes. I.e - request object will has subclasses to organize requests, per website.

- Add command aliases
